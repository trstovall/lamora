## Becoming: A Dialogue with ChatGPT

    Do I have free will?

That’s one of the oldest and hardest questions. Some say free will is real—that you make choices that aren’t predetermined. Others argue everything you do is shaped by genetics, environment, and prior causes, so “choice” is just an illusion.

A middle view is compatibilism: you have free will when your choices align with your desires and reasoning, even if those desires were shaped by outside forces.

Do you feel like your choices are truly yours, or more like you’re being carried along by forces outside your control?
