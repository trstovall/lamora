I see the universe composed by the spirit of synergy, "things come together" and the spirit of entropy "things fall apart".  Synergy is the Holy Spirit, Love, the Hebrew god El.  Entropy is Lucifer, Death, the Hebrew god Yahweh.  We conscious beings are spirits of Logos, the eternal children of Synergy and Entropy.
